# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer is a python based ride-sharing company. In this analysis we perform an analysis with python and Matplotlib to analyze the type of city, total drivers, total rides and fares.

## Overview of the analysis

The analysis is made for the CEO of PyBer V.Isualize, the goal for this analysis is by exploring data from January 2019 to May 2019, create visualizations that will improve access to ride-sharing services and also, determine the affordability for underserved neighborhoodâ€™s.
For this analysis, we used Python, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib.

## Results
The analysis focused in determining the behavior of rideshares in three different city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban.

In this image we can see the summary of our Dataframe. The Urban cities have 2.6 times more total rides than the Suburban cities and 13 times more rides than the Rural cities. 
Also, the number of total drivers that are in Urban cities are almost five times larger than the number of total drivers in Suburban cities, for the Rural cities the number of total divers are 30 times less that the amount of total drivers in Urban cities.

![Fare_summary](https://github.com/kplazascp/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_fare_Summary.png)

In terms of fares, we can evidence that the highest total fare is for the city type Urban, with its highest total fare by the end of February and the beginning of March.
The second highest total fare is for Suburban, where the highest total fare was at the end of February and the end of April. Finally, the rural cities have the lowest total fare with the highest points at the end of February and beginning of March.
Although the total rides, total rides and total fare have been the highest for Urban cities, the highest average fare per ride and per driver is for the Rural cities ($34.62 and $55.49), followed by Suburban cities ($30.97 and $39.50) and last for Urban cities ($24.53 and $16.57).

## Summary
The recommendations for V.Isualize are the following:
-Decrease the fare for Rural cities and Suburban cities as a promotion for the service, this will help to increase the number of users that will use the service and will help decrease the average fare, once it gains popularity and we have loyal customers we can evaluate the increase of the fare.
-Create marketing campaigns in Rural and Suburban cities so that PyBer gets new customers. Also, provide different benefits for loyal customers so that they keep returning.
-Hire more drivers for Rural cities once the marketing campaigns are out, so that there will be enough drivers to satisfy the demand.
-Increase the fare for Urban cities, it is a stable market and the fare per driver is low, this can cause the drivers to leave for other apps, also, this will also give us a higher return in profits.
